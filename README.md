## About the Video Course
In this course, we'll explore the C programming language from the ground up. We'll begin with a brief section on computer basics followed by a Hello world program in C and a walk-through to understand its elements and to dissect it. You will be introduced to the main elements of C like data types, operators, arrays, strings, pointers...etc. We will cover ALL C KEYWORDS in this course, when and how to use them with coding examples! I have dedicated entire sections for pointers, arrays, and strings. This course has the most extensive details on how and why we need pointers and how to avid pointer related gotchas. I guarantee you will not find any other course that covers pointers in this depth with easy to understand and follow examples like this course. There is even a full section on mastering Visual Studio included here for free so you can master using it for C/C++ and even C# as well as Visual Basic. This course will help you learn and master C language and become a professional programmer on your own pace by watching me as I introduce you to the concepts and fundamentals of programming and writing efficient code in C with easy to follow lectures that are full of hands-on practices and coding! During this course, I will share with you the tips and tricks of the trade that I learned throughout my 20+ years of professional career as a software engineer! I will teach you C language and programming from the ground up as I assume you have no prior programming experience. I have included sections for people who have never programmed before, but for those who are already programming, they can either watch them refresh on some fundamentals or simply chose to skip them altogether. If you want to become a professional software developer then search no more, you have found the right course!
